            Justice should be equal . . . right? From the perspective of the
            elite these are just nothing but a mere joke to them. Would you
            rather hear "It was only a Tip and a Thanks for letting me get away
            with what I have done."? I'd rather not, justice isn't about siding
            on who's got the "Money" or "I'm a Politician", it's about being
            treated equally cause in the eyes of the law nothing is above it.
            These "Politicians" are said to be law abiding citizens yet they use
            their position and their so called "Money" which we all know that
            its the people's money, the tax that came from the public are used
            for their personal use and they took advantage of it.

            The fact that the Philippine Government is already filled with
            corruption, many people doesn't get the right treatment they
            deserve. People who's got the money, the position, the fame are the
            ones who mostly gets the respect but if you're at the lowest of the
            low you’re just a nobody to them. Every law abiding citizen here in
            this country pay taxes, and what are these “Taxes” for? These are
            collected by the Government to fund public services, let’s say
            Financial Aid for public schools or welfare programs for the poor,
            Infrastructure, Agriculture and so on. Yet where are these taxes
            that came from the people, why aren’t any changes that happened, why
            are the roads still broken, why does flood keeps on occurring, why
            does the poor gets poorer? A lot of different question arise from
            the public and yet not a single truth is unveiled. We, the public,
            the people of this forsaken country deserves the truth. We are being
            robbed by the government, why does the justice side with these
            burglars and liars, are they too afraid to speak up? or are they
            kept quiet because they were paid by using the citizens money? It’s
            a big joke to say that these are what they call “JUSTICE”, but do
            remember this, “There is no secret that cannot be revealed”.
