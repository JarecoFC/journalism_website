            The Philippines is a country that fought for its own sense of
            nationalism and freedom, freedom that countless of people have
            sacrificed their lives all for the sake of a better tomorrow for the
            people of the future generations. They knew they were out-matched,
            out-gunned and out-numbered but they kept fighting tooth and nail to
            ensure that a better and peaceful life is within the grasp of the
            Filipinos of the future generations to come. And now we live in an
            era of mostly peace, where most world leaders would opt to resolve
            situations through diplomatic means yet that goal for a better
            livelihood for Filipinos is still far out of reach and it’s not
            because of outsiders ironically It’s because of our fellow Filipinos
            that are up on the top.

            Disdain from the common Filipino folk towards the leading government
            isn’t an entirely new thing, though there has been a recent
            realization from a few yet many Filipinos that have had enough of
            the betrayal of the government that was entrusted to serve the
            country. The government which is supposedly a country’s symbol of
            hope is now just a self-sustaining hungry machine that embraces its
            greed. This awakening led to the recent rally / protest that
            occurred that showed and vocalized the frustrations, anger and
            disappointment of the Filipinos towards the people that the common
            folk pay a cut of their income towards. That many people paying
            their taxes, taken directly away from the money that was supposed to
            feed their families and yet they barely see or touch the fruits that
            were promised to them. Decade old problems worsening, which makes
            the day to day struggle of a Filipino even harder than it has to be.
            Picture a man who is trying to earn a living walking the same
            sidewalk for years, as the amount of taxes he has paid almost form a
            mountain so does the sidewalk turn into crooked rubble more akin to
            a crater. The anger, the frustration, the cries during the day of
            the rally is barely scratches the surface of what has been building
            up inside these people.

            What’s more surprising is how they mock us, belittle us, see us as
            mindless dolls to fill their pockets while they sit around and do
            nothing; actually they do less than nothing as they even prevent
            from projects aimed for the welfare of Filipinos from happening to
            make sure they squeeze as much money as they can from us. They
            flaunt their wealth as if it was truly theirs, showing luxury
            clothing and cars as they post going to famous events. While a
            school in the main capital is barely accommodating the students they
            have, a local hospital’s building showing cracks on its walls and
            even a whole city that accepts daily floods in their neighborhoods
            as the norm.

            We cannot allow our country to be siphoned of its riches, the common
            folk bled dry for the ever consuming machine of greed and
            self-interest that we now call our government. If we are not to act
            then we cannot expect things to get better as in reality, it will
            only get worse from here. We’ve waited more than long enough for the
            government to right its wrongs, to prove to use that they are
            competent leaders capable of serving for the welfare of all as that
            has been proven wrong for so many times. We must not stand idly and
            we should take this amalgamation of greed off of its seat and
            reclaim the government that is meant to be for the people and serves
            the people.
