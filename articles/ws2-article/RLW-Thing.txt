Caption 1: Traffic counterflow
"Against for Good"
Going the wrong way just to get to the right way.

The image shows heavy traffic,
	and on the other side of the lane shows the same traffic but it is counterflowing.
Traffic is inevitable, it will happen anyways. It is just the matter on how often it happens and how bad it will get,
	but here it happens pretty much every day of the week.
This would not happen as much if the spending goes to better the public transport,
	but instead, a lot of it just gets pocketed.
This does not just happen with the roads, but even services meant to serve the common folks,
This is also one of the reasons why quite a bit of people would do anything just to get their needs and wants,
	whether if it is the right way or the wrong way.	 


Caption 2: PMA replica aircrafts
"Lost Greatness"
Used to had it all, be one of the best, now it's all history.

(Explantion:)
This image shows one of the Philippines' air asset for defense back then.
This was used as a means of deterrence and a show of force of the Philippines.
The Philippines had it good back then,
	if anything, we had one of the best airforce in the entire south east asia.
As time goes on, those assets go on to become obsolete and outdated,
	leading to dwindling numbers left.
Nowadays, that greatness was the past, and now we are just only catching up.
This catching up should not be happening right now, when it could have happened way before.
Instead of giving back to the people and the country, "they" give it only to themselves instead.
